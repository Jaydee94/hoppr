### Virtual categories

Two virtual categories appear at the top of the category list when they have content:

- **🕒 Recent** — last 10 connections you made (persisted across sessions).
- **★ Starred** — hosts you marked with `f`. Select a host and press `f` again to unstar.

Both virtual categories support the normal search query and vim navigation.

## Edit mode (settings)

Open with `e`. Esc returns to the previous screen.

### Settings menu

```
▍ Manage categories
  Manage hosts
  Connection defaults
  Central repo sync
```

- **Manage categories** — list, add (`a`), rename (`r` / `Enter`), delete (`d`).
- **Manage hosts** — `Tab` cycles between categories. Same `a/r/d` semantics.
- **Connection defaults** — edit `defaults.command` (program), default port, default user.
- **Central repo sync** — edit the `sync.*` block. Tab/↑↓ moves through the six form fields and the three action buttons underneath; `Space` toggles `auto-pull` / `auto-push`; `Enter` either applies the form (text fields), flips the toggle (booleans), or fires the button. `Ctrl+S` is a universal save shortcut.

### Sync editor controls

| element / key            | action                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑↓ Tab`                 | Move between fields and the three action buttons                       |
| `Space`                  | Toggle `auto-pull` / `auto-push` on the focused boolean row            |
| `Enter` on a text field  | Apply the form (auto-clones the repo if missing locally)               |
| `Enter` on a toggle      | Flip the boolean                                                       |
| `[Test connection]`      | Probe the repo URL currently in the form via libgit2 `ls-remote`       |
| `[Sync now]`             | Apply the form, then clone or fast-forward pull                        |
| `[Save]`                 | Apply the form, then write the local config to disk (+ push on auto_push) |
| `Ctrl+S`                 | Same as the `[Save]` button — universal save shortcut                  |
| `Esc`                    | Back to the settings menu                                              |

## Mnemonics

- `e` for **edit** — opens settings.
- `s` for **save** — flush to disk.
- `r` for **rename / replace** — also acts as "edit selected".
- `/` from many TUIs you've used before.

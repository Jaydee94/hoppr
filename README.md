## What it does

`hoppr` is a tiny TUI you keep on a hotkey. Type to fuzzy-search hosts, hit `↩` to drop into an SSH session — no shell aliases to maintain, no copy-pasting from a notes file. Hosts live in a YAML file you can edit by hand, from inside the TUI, or sync from a central git repo across your machines.

```bash
$ hoppr            # interactive TUI
$ hoppr connect prod-gateway
$ hoppr list --category prod
$ hoppr sync push  # commit + push your local edits upstream
```

## Highlights

- **Fast TUI** — built on [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), opens in < 50 ms.
- **In-TUI settings** — add hosts, edit categories, change defaults, save to YAML. No shelling out to an editor.
- **Team inventory in git** — point at a repo URL; hoppr auto-clones, fast-forward pulls the shared categories & hosts on every launch, pushes the inventory subset when you want. Your local `defaults` and `sync` settings stay on your machine.
- **Pluggable connect command** — defaults to `ssh`, supports `mosh`, `telnet`, `kitty +kitten ssh`, raw shell, or any custom template with `{user}` `{host}` `{port}` placeholders.
- **Favorites & history** — `f` stars a host into a virtual `★ Starred` category. The last 10 connections appear under `🕒 Recent`. Both persist across sessions, never synced to the central repo.
- **Global search** — `Ctrl+A` while searching switches to cross-category fuzzy search; results show the originating category name.
- **New-window launch** — `Shift+Enter` opens the connection in a fresh terminal window. hoppr auto-detects Windows Terminal, iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or xterm; override via `defaults.terminal_command`.
- **CLI parity** — every TUI action is also a subcommand (`connect`, `list`, `sync`, `config`, `history`).
- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, Windows. Single static binary.

## Install

hoppr                    # launch the TUI
```

Inside the TUI:

| key       | action                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Tab`     | switch between Categories / Hosts |
| `/`       | search                          |
| `↑ ↓ j k` | navigate                        |
| `↩`       | connect to the selected host    |
| `e`       | open the in-TUI settings menu   |
| `q` `Esc` | quit                            |
